Welcome to my Portfolio repository

## Overview
Although I've been working as a software developer for a little while now, I decided that I needed a page to introduce myself, where people could understand some of my goals and expertise.

For this project I chose to go with plain and simple HTML5, CSS and JavaScript as I thought would be necessary.

In order to make my life easier, this page is using the following tools:

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/ "NodeJS")
* [Bower](https://bower.io/ "Bower")
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/ "Gulp")

If you want to run this application locally you can follow the steps:

1. NodeJS: Download from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "NodeJS")
2. Bower: ```npm install bower -g```
3. Gulp: ```npm install gulp -g```

Once you have your environment ready you can start the app by running the following commands on your terminal: 

1. ```npm install```
2. ```bower install```
3. ```gulp```
